#+title: Readme
* learning to use scala-cli in the most simple way:
** i've just added 'scala-cli' into nix shell
and most recent is the 1.0.1 that's good
now overview: https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/overview
** doing "scala-cli ." will compile all files in the directory and have them be available for referencing
and adding --watch would run again on completion&code change
adding --restart would restart on code change, what i'd prefer with web services, yay

so, just reference other files, they are picked up from whole . directory, cool

and I guess i'll be mostly using
#+begin_src bash
scala-cli . --restart
#+end_src

for my future experiments with cask web server, because it stays alive until it's killed
** oh, it can do formatting!
scala-cli fmt
** ok, that's about running : https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/commands/run
and later would be nice to do tests and other things
tests : https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/commands/test
repl : https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/commands/repl
can start with specific file in scope
** so, repl
doing
#+begin_src bash
scala-cli repl .
#+end_src

will open repl with all entities from files available for interactive use, that's neat
