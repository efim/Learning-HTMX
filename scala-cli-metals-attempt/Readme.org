* Attempting to have metals set up in a scala-cli project
** now, integration with metals..
https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/cookbooks/vscode/ - this is directly with metals
overall with ide's - https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/guides/ide/
*** put files into /src/main/scala
and tests into /src/test/scala
then i suppose close projectile tab, visit file and interactively select the project root, maybe that would be enough
*** yeah, i think this is very much working.
** generating .gitignore hmm
https://scala-cli.virtuslab.org/docs/commands/misc/default-file/

scala-cli default-file --write .gitignore
** adding dependencies
//> using dep org.scalameta::munit::1.0.0-M1

i guess good enough for the super small projects with very few files?
and i could set it in main class and they hopefully will be available for import in other files, right?
