    The team was very supportive and kept me motivated

    “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile engineer
    for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and
    learning from their experiences was easy.

    “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

    Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
    student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
    did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
    100% recommend! ”
