#+title: Readme
* attempting to set up something more complex in a single small project
** adding dependencies:
#+begin_src scala
//> using dep com.lihaoyi::pprint:0.8.1
#+end_src

this should be on the very top of the file, otherwise it's not visible to scala-cli

that was my error for a while - having package declaration on top
** replicating simplest cask example
https://github.com/com-lihaoyi/cask/blob/master/example/minimalApplication/app/src/MinimalApplication.scala
*** and it works!
opening localhost:8080 shows "Hello world!"

and opening Network tab, refreshing to see get request,
and doing "Edit and Resend" to issue Post to /do-thing with some text in body
returns the result with test reversed.

this is really nice.
** what i'd really like though is browser refresh.
i suppose that can be added to emacs? also on file save :shrug: somehow
** for the future - more details on things of cask
